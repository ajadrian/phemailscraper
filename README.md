Scrubs your clipboard for phone numbers &amp; email addresses.

Scrape and filter content for email address and phone number

Step 1: Copy the text you wish to extract phone numbers and email addresses from to your clipboard.

Step 2: Run the program.

Step 3: Type either '1' to save the results to a .txt file, or '2' to save the results to your clipboard (overriding your previous clipboard). If you choose to save the results to a .txt file, it will display the path before prompting you to quit. If you choose to use it again, it will append the results to the same file, and the results will be separated with a dashed line. You can also type 'd' to delete the file.

Working on a version that will read .txt files instead of taking clipboard input. Depending on when you're reading this, it might already be out. After that's finished, maybe I'll work on a GUI version, featuring an option to save it to your clipboard or a specific path and accept input from .txt or clipboard.
